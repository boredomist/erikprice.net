  <p>
    Hi there, I'm Erik. I'm an undergraduate Computer Science and German
    student at the University of Wisconsin â€” Madison. I'm <em>probably</em>
    graduating spring 2015.
  </p>

  <p>
    I pretend to be a developer most of the time, and occasionally successfully
    manage to pass for a somewhat decent one. I'm interested in programming
    languages, cryptography, general purpose GPU, and a whole bunch of other
    stuff. Really, I just like programming.
  </p>

  <p>
    I really try not to limit myself to a single paradigm or style. I love
    learning new languages and frameworks, and really enjoy picking up new ways
    of thinking about things.

    I've also implemented way too many languages
    [<a href="https://github.com/erik/gob">1</a>,
    <a href="https://github.com/erik/arroyo">2</a>,
    <a href="https://github.com/erik/frink">3</a>,
    <a href="https://github.com/erik/froth">4</a>,
    <a href="https://github.com/erik/lispr">5</a>,
    <a href="https://github.com/erik/ruse">6</a>,
    <a href="https://github.com/erik/some-kind-of-lisp">7</a>,
    <a href="https://github.com/erik/janeiro">8</a>,
    <a href="https://github.com/erik/cl-froth">9</a>]
    and virtual machines
    [<a href="https://github.com/erik/atto">1</a>,
    <a href="https://github.com/erik/bijou">2</a>,
    <a href="https://github.com/erik/chip8">3</a>,
    <a href="https://github.com/erik/loki">4</a>],
    in my spare time.
  </p>

  <p>
    I've done some research work with general purpose GPU computing for global
    climate modeling software. One of the projects I developed is the topic of
    <a href="http://proceedings.spiedigitallibrary.org/proceeding.aspx?articleid=1761940">
      this paper</a>, which was presented at the SPIE Remote Sensing
    conference in 2013. Papers for some other projects will be published in
    2014.
  </p>

  <p>
    Quite a few of my personal programming projects end up on Github
    eventually, almost all of them with basically no practical
    use. However, if you are so inclined, you can find my Github
    profile <a href="http://github.com/erik">here</a>. Also, go check out my
    explanations of some things on the <a href="/projects">projects page</a>.
  </p>

  <p>
    By now, you hopefully have a decent idea of who I am. If you would like to
    get in contact with me, send me an email, I'd love to hear from you,
    internet stranger.
  </p>

  <p>
    Yep.
