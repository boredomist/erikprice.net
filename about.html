      <h1>About Me</h1>
      <div>
        <p>
          Hi there, I'm Erik. I'm an undergraduate Computer Science and German student at
          the University of Wisconsin â€” Madison.
        </p>

        <p>
          I pretend to be a programmer most of the time, and occasionally
          successfully manage to pass for a somewhat decent one. I'm interested
          in programming language design, and try not to limit myself to a
          single paradigm or style. I've implemented way too many (terribly
          designed) languages
          [<a href="https://github.com/erik/gob">1</a>,

          and virtual machines
          [<a href="https://github.com/erik/atto">1</a>,
          <a href="https://github.com/erik/bijou">2</a>,
          <a href="https://github.com/erik/chip8">3</a>,
          <a href="https://github.com/erik/loki">4</a>],
          and love picking up languages and ideas, new
          and old.
        </p>

        <p>
          I've done some research work with general purpose GPU computing for
          global climate modeling software. One of the projects I developed is
          the topic of
          <a href="http://proceedings.spiedigitallibrary.org/proceeding.aspx?articleid=1761940">
          this paper</a>, which was presented at the SPIE Remote Sensing
          conference in 2013. Papers for some other projects will be published
          in early 2014.
        </p>

        <p>
          Quite a few of my personal programming projects end up on Github
          eventually, almost all of them with basically no practical
          use. However, if you are so inclined, you can find my Github
          profile <a href="http://github.com/erik">here</a>.
        </p>

        <p>
          My musical tastes seem to change radically from year to year, so
          there's not much point in trying to define them here. If for whatever
          reason you care what I listen to, I have a Last.fm profile,
          <a href="http://www.last.fm/user/erikprice">here</a>. That should give
          a bit of an idea what I currently listen to.
        </p>

        <p>
          By now, you hopefully have a decent idea of who I am. If you would
          like to get in contact with me, you may do so through
          <a href="mailto&#058erik&#064erikprice&#046net">email</a> or, if you
          absolutely must, by telephone, at +1-973-512-8223. For the
          cryptographers, my PGP <a href="erikprice.asc">public key</a>
          (<a href="http://pgp.mit.edu:11371/pks/lookup?op=vindex&search=0x6BC5BEEC6215B5F7">
          MIT Keyserver</a>) is available.
        </p>

        <p>
          Yep.
