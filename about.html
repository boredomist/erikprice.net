        <p>
          Hi there, as you have probably already figured out, my name is Erik
          Price. I'm a Sophomore at the University of Wisconsin â€” Madison, in
          the class of 2016. I'm studying Computer Science and some German on
          the side.
        </p>

        <p>
          I pretend to be a programmer most of the time, and occasionally
          successfully manage to pass for a somewhat decent one. I'm interested
          in programming language design, and try not to limit myself to a
          single paradigm or style. I've implemented way too many (bad)
          languages and virtual machines myself, and love picking up languages
          and ideas, new and old.
        </p>

        <p>
          I'm a supporter of free software, and use as little proprietary
          software as I possible. That said, I try to remain pragmatic, and will
          use the better option over the more 'free' option. I run GNU/Linux on
          several computers, using a couple different distributions, but I'm
          most comfortable with Gentoo. I also spend an absurd amount of my day
          in Emacs, using it for everything I can.
        </p>

        <p>
          Quite a few of my programming projects end up on Github eventually,
          almost all of them with basically no practical use. However, if you
          are so inclined, you can find my Github
          profile <a href="http://github.com/boredomist">here</a>.
        </p>

        <p>
          My musical tastes seem to change radically from year to year, so
          there's not much point in trying to define them here. If for whatever
          reason you care what I listen to, I have a Last.fm profile,
          <a href="http://www.last.fm/user/erikprice">here</a>. That should give
          a bit of an idea what I currently listen to.
        </p>

        <p>
          By now, you hopefully have a decent idea of who I am. If you would
          like to get in contact with me, you may do so through
          <a href="mailto&#058erik&#064erikprice&#046net">email</a> or, if you
          absolutely must, by telephone, at +1-973-512-8223. For the
          cryptographers, my PGP <a href="erikprice.asc">public key</a>
          (<a href="http://pgp.mit.edu:11371/pks/lookup?op=vindex&search=0x6BC5BEEC6215B5F7">
          MIT Keyserver</a>) is available.
        </p>

        <p>
          Yep.
